1. Tutorial: registered 41 targets destroyed after level completed, even though there are only 40 targets in levelData.
 - Some targets loaded twice?
 - EnemyManager :: increaseKilledEnemies called too many times?

2. Flying level 4: rocketEngine ambience continues after the death skull disappears.
 - Would be cooler if the rocketEngine was quiet here.
