1. Gameplay appears choppy in windowed mode
   -EDIT: By searching through some blog posts, it seems that this is a commonly known
   issue with the LWJGL engine. I didn't see anyone with a fix for the problem.
   -WORKAROUND: Start the application in fullscreen mode, but keep the option to switch
   to windowed mode. If users want to sacrifice a smooth FPS for playing in windowed mode,
   they can choose to do that.

2. Flying level 4: after the Death skull appears, rocket engine ambience can be turned back on if you pause and then unpause

3. Technical improvement - See if there's a better way to handle starting a song the first time you enter an exploring-level.
